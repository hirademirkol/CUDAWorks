# Boids
Implementing [Boids](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html) on CUDA

Started the implementation using the OpenGL-CUDA groundwork from [NVIDIA CUDA Particle Simulation Sample](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/2_Concepts_and_Techniques/particles). Boid system is implemented instead of particle system and renderer is changed.

Developed and tried on Ubuntu 20.04, with CUDA Toolkit 11.5.

### Things to add:
- Avoiding walls
- Avoiding external objects
- Better shading
