# Boids
Implementing and Boids on CUDA

Started the implementation using the OpenGL-CUDA groundwork from [NVIDIA CUDA Particle Simulation Sample](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/2_Concepts_and_Techniques/particles). Boid system is going to be implemented instead of particle system and renderer will be changed.
